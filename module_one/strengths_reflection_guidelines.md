# Introductory Strengths Reflection & Coaching Request

### In-Class Reflections Using the Signature Themes Report
**Read through the definitions**:

1. What words or phrases stick out to you for each theme?
> Restorative: "It's very likely that you unlock the door to succes by conquering your shortcomings. You intentionally set goals that force you to confront your weaknesses."
> Deliberative: "You are somewhat private about your personal life [...] You are likely to excuse yourself from discussions about the upbringing, finances, problems, physical conditions, or mental health of yourself and other people."
> Focus: "It's very likely that you sometimes question how well you are doing in certain aspects of your life. You might aspire to higher levels of excellence."
> Intellection: "You are doubly blessed: You think with your head and feel with your heart [...] Your definition of 'recreational reading' probably differs from that of many people [...] Few things please you as much as having mastered a subject that interests you."
> Futuristic: "You sometimes like being an individual performer [...] being alone permits you to concentrate your energy on what you want to accomplish in the coming months, year, or decades."

### Look at the Suggested Action Items

10. How will you communicate with your mentor and/or students that you work with about your strengths?

### Repeating the Module
If you've reflected on your StrengthsFinder results previously, here are some additional questions you may want to consider during this second module:

* How did you see yourself using your strengths last module?
* When did you overuse any of your strengths? When did you underuse them?
* What did you realize about yourself both in your struggles and in your wins last module?
* How could you capitalize on your strengths more effectively this time through the module?
* How did working with others last module affect how you understand your strengths?
* What goals for your personal development do you want to make for this module? How will you know if you've achieved them?

### Next Steps
This reflection is for your own growth, and you do not need to turn this in.
