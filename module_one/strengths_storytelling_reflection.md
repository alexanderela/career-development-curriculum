# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection 

1. **Who are you:** Write 1-2 paragraphs about how you've seen yourself using your StrengthsFinder themes and/or how you've seen yourself grow during this module at Turing. 
>When we first did the StrengthsFinder exercise, I was very interested to learn that I had the strength with the name, Restorative. One of the hallmark characteristics of this strength is that rather than capitalizing on my strengths, I put the majority of my efforts into improving my weaknesses.


2. **Why are you here:** When have you struggled at Turing? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

3. **What's next:** Share your vision statement for what you see as your place in the tech industry and how your journey into this new career ends.

4. After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?
